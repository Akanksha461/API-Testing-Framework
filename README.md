# Totojitu

here is a collection file(https://github.com/Akanksha461/Totojitu/blob/master/Totojitu-New1.postman_collection) and environment file (https://github.com/Akanksha461/Totojitu/blob/master/Totojitu.postman_environment)for the api containing 50+ assesrtions for each api.
I have used 'POSTMAN BDD' using chai asserstion written the asserstions.

# Checked the status code 

Using python i have written script using request library we are able to know the status of api and if there is any issue developers recieve Email and text message. Here is the link (https://github.com/Akanksha461/Totojitu/blob/master/status_code.py)

For continuous integration i have used jenkins so that our script run after each time spam.
