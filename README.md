# Totojitu

here is a collection file(https://github.com/Akanksha461/Totojitu/blob/master/Totojitu-New1.postman_collection) and environment file (https://github.com/Akanksha461/Totojitu/blob/master/Totojitu.postman_environment) for the api containing 50+ assesrtions for each api.
I have used 'POSTMAN BDD' using chai asserstion written the asserstions.

# Checked the status code 

 Here i have written python script using request library we are able to know the status of api . The main perspective of this script is that incase  of any technical issue or server related issue developers should be informed immediately via Email and text message. Here is the link (https://github.com/Akanksha461/Totojitu/blob/master/status_code.py)

For continuous integration i have used jenkins so that our script run after each time spam.
